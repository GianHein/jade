# Jade Engine

Welcome to the **Jade Engine** repository! This project is a 2D game engine written in Java, using LWJGL 3 as its backend. It was developed as I followed along with the "[Coding a 2D Game Engine in Java](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtrSb4XxIVbp8AKuEAlwNXDxr99e3woGE)" series by [GamesWithGabe](https://www.youtube.com/@GamesWithGabe) on YouTube.

> **Note:** I abandoned the project after completing 36 episodes of the series. I decided that I had learned enough from this journey and chose to move on to my real goal of learning game engine programming with C++.

## About the Project

- **Purpose:**  
  The primary goal of this project was to learn how game engines work while following an engaging tutorial series. Although the code may have deviated slightly from the original in some areas, my intention was to keep it as close as possible to the source material while occasionally experimenting with new features.

- **Original Source:**  
  The code for the series can be found on [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/codingminecraft/Mario).

- **Future Plans:**  
  While I might revisit or repurpose parts of this engine for small projects in the future, this repository will remain as a record of my learning journey and experimentation with Java, LWJGL 3, and 2D game engine architecture.

## Project Progress

I followed the tutorial series and completed the code-along for the first **36 episodes**. After reaching that point, I decided to move on to learning game engine programming in C++ and exploring OpenGL.
